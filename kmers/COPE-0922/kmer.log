running histogram estimation
File kmers/COPE-0922/reads_file.txt starts with character "f", hence is interpreted as a list of file names
Reading 2 read files
Linear estimation: ~5584 M distinct 71-mers are in the reads
K-mer sampling: 1/1065
going to estimate histograms for values of k: 121 111 101 91 81 71 61 51 41 31 21 
fitting model to histograms to estimate best k
estimation of the best k so far: 111
refining estimation around [105; 117], with a step of 2
